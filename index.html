<p>WASHINGTON — The United States and China have agreed that an initial trade deal between the two countries would roll back a portion of the tariffs placed on each other’s products, a significant step toward defusing tensions between the world’s largest economies.
</p><p>
The so-called phase one agreement has not yet been finalized,  and a deal could fail to materialize as it has in previous rounds of negotiations. But if a pact is reached, the Trump administration has committed to rolling back tariffs, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
</p><p>
The commitment marks the first time the United States has agreed to remove any of the tariffs it has placed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods. While President Trump canceled a planned tariff increase in October, he has routinely dangled the prospect of additional tariffs if Beijing does not change its economic practices and accede to America’s trade terms.
</p> <p>
The development suggests the two sides are getting closer to a deal that would provide relief to businesses and consumers that have struggled with the additional costs of tariffs. Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are facing increasing political and economic pressure to resolve their 19-month trade fight, which has inflicted pain on both sides of the Pacific.</p>
