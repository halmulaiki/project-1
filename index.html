  Munder Difflin – Dunder Mifflin’s Sister Co</p>
  <p>Munder Difflin Paper Co is the sister company of the great Dunder Mifflin Paper Co. The majority of people in the world (100% if you have a Netflix account) are familiar with the TV series, “The Office.” That’s how Dunder Mifflin became famous and stayed in business for 9 years!</p>

<p>
  Well, Munder Difflin has been in business for 6 months and we didn’t need some multi-million dollar TV production to keep us afloat. All we need, and what we pride ourself in, is the best paper in town!</p>

  <p>Work in an office? Own a mailbox? Pay with cash? Whoever you are, and whatever you do, if you live in Scranton, Pennsylvania, you use our paper every day. If you are the one in a million that doesn’t, you should, because “Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.” – Dwight Schrute</p>
